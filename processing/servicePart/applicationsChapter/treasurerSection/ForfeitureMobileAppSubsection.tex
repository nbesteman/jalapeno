\subsection{Forfeiture Data Collection}

\subsubsection{Problem and Analysis}

\paragraph{Background}
Treasurer department has an annual responsibility to properly document the tax forfeiture process.  The LIS Department built an application in MS Access and MapInfo that consumed a daily export from BSA and was deployed to the field on a laptop.  A digital camera was used for site photos and later imported into the laptop.

\paragraph{Statement of Problem}
Current Tax Forfeiture workflow is built on MapInfo software which has been replaced by ESRI software.  The Forfeiture data collection application must be recreated in the ESRI framework.

\paragraph{Analysis}
Tax Forfeiture Application will facilitate:

\begin{itemize} %1

\item Mobile data collection on handheld device via Collector for ArcGIS configured with Allegan County GIS Portal  (\textbf{device app})

\begin{itemize} %2

\item Device app will:

\begin{itemize} %3

\item Synchronize with data in the office (online)
\item Navigate to forfeiture sites (offline)
\item Collect data and photos of forfeiture sites (offline)
\item Synchronize the collected data with data in the office (online)
\end{itemize} %3

\end{itemize} %2

\item Daily form production and printing for each site visited with required data and images.

\end{itemize} %1

\subsubsection{Design}
\paragraph{Overview}This Application utilizes Treasurer Department data to document the forfeiture process.  An enterprise GIS deployment enables offline data collection by up to two users.

\subparagraph*{}There are three stages to daily workflow: Preprocessing, Field Collection, and Postprocessing.  Forfeiture Parcels, is a map feature class that is processed in the office via the network and remotely via the internet.
\clearpage
\subparagraph{Workflow Summary}
\begin{description}
\item [Preprocessing] The data is updated to match the Treasures data in BSAforfeiture.net and synchronized to two android mobile devices.
\item [Field data collection] The two mobile devices are used to collect info required, one for all the attributes, the other for photos.
\item[Postprocessing] The mobile devices are syncronized back to the network data and a form is exported for each site visited that day.
\end{description}


\paragraph{Technologies Used}
\subparagraph{BSA Data}Details of parcels in the forfeiture process are managed in BSA Delinquent Tax.net.  The Treasurer office does a BSA export of the parcels in need of a site visit in the preprocessing.

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Desktop}Tools are designed to preprocess and postprocess forfeiture parcel data for fieldwork.  The user will execute a preprocess script tool that prepares the data for field deployment.  After fieldwork, a post process script tool syncronizes data from the fieldwork with the live data on the Allegan County network. 

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Collector}A free mobile application developed and tested on Android is deployed to the field for data collection.  The application is configured to work offline(without an internet or cellular connection) by syncronizing before and after fieldwork.

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Portal Webmaps and Apps}Live data from a publishing enterprise geodatabase(ACPub), running on SQL Server database server (acintsql01) is provided through a feature service (REST service)  named TaxReversionParcels.  A webmap called the Forfeiture Field Map consumes the TaxReversionParcels feature service, exposing the data to editing.  The Forfeiture Field Map is configured to work in the ArcGIS Collector App.  The app downloads the webmap, allowing the user to collect the necessary information on each forfeiture parcel in the field disconnected and uploads the changes when reconnected. 

\paragraph{Field Data Collection}

Three parts of the daily routine:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pre-processing (in the office):

\begin{itemize}
\item Export current forfeiture list from BSA
\item Update webmap layers with results from BSA export
\item Synchronize from webmap layers to field collection devices \textbf{(device app)}
\end{itemize}

\item Field data collection with device app:

\begin{itemize}
\item Navigation to forfeiture sites is aided by users location shown in map
\item A Checklist of data points about the site
\item Attach photos to the site
\item Save results for synchronization in post-processing
\end{itemize}

\item Post-processing (in the office)

\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronize data and images collected in device app to webmap layers

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
