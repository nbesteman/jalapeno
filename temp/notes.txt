\paragraph{Technologies Used in The Forfeiture App}
\subparagraph{BSA Data}Details of parcels in the forfeiture process are managed in BSA Delinquent Tax.net.  The Treasurer office does a BSA export of the parcels in need of a site visit in the preprocessing.

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Desktop}Tools are designed to preprocess and postprocess forfeiture parcel data for fieldwork.  The user will execute a preprocess script tool that prepares the data for field deployment.  After fieldwork, a post process script tool syncronizes data from the fieldwork with the live data on the Allegan County network.

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Collector}A free mobile application developed and tested on Android is deployed to the field for data collection.  The application is configured to work offline(without an internet or cellular connection) by syncronizing before and after fieldwork. The user collects the necessary information on each forfeiture parcel in the field disconnected, and then uploads the changes when reconnected.

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Enterprise Geodatabse}Live data from a publishing geodatabase(ACPub), running on SQL Server database server (acintsql01) provides access to Forfeiture Parcels

\subparagraph{ArcGIS Portal Webmaps and Apps} Forfeiture Parcels is served as a feature service (REST service)  named TaxReversionParcels.  A webmap on Portal, called the Forfeiture Field Map consumes the TaxReversionParcels exposing the data to editing.  The Forfeiture Field Map is configured to work in the ArcGIS Collector App.
